# ScreenSound2
Improvement of the previous music register in a C# console app. Using an external API of musics lists and OpenAI's API integration!
 
# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
 
- ````Git````: Make sure Git is installed on your machine. You can download ````Git```` from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
- ````Visual Studio````: Install Visual Studio, an IDE specifically designed for ````C#```` development. You can download the Community edition (which is free for individual developers) from the official website: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads.
 
# Downloading and Opening the C# Repository
Follow the steps below to download and open a ````C#```` repository from GitHub:
 
### Clone the Repository:
 
- Open your preferred command-line interface (CLI) or Git GUI application.
 
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
 
- Execute the following command to clone the repository:
````git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git````
Replace username with the username of the repository owner, and repository with the name of the repository.
 
### Open the Repository in Visual Studio:
 
- Launch Visual Studio.
- Select ````"Open a project or solution"```` from the start window, or click on ````"File"```` and then ````"Open"```` if you already have Visual Studio open.
- Browse to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the solution file (usually with a ````.sln```` extension).
- Click ````"Open"```` to load the repository in Visual Studio.
 
# About the .NET Framework
The ````.NET framework```` is a software development platform created by Microsoft. It provides a comprehensive set of libraries, tools, and runtime environments to build different types of applications, including those written in ````C#````.
 
Visual Studio includes the .NET framework as part of its installation. It offers a rich set of features and tools to develop, test, and deploy ````C#```` applications efficiently.
 
When working with ````C#```` repositories, ensure that you have the appropriate ````.NET framework```` version installed that matches the project's requirements. You can manage different ````.NET framework```` versions through Visual Studio's project settings.

# Generate OpenAI API Key
Here's a quick step-by-step guide on how to create an API key for the OpenAI API, along with an explanation that the existing key expires after three months:
 
 - Log in to your OpenAI account: Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the OpenAI website. Enter your username and password to log in.
 - Access your API settings: Once you're logged in, navigate to the API settings page within your OpenAI account. This is typically found in your account or profile settings.
 - Generate a new API key: Look for the option to generate a new API key or access token. Click on it to create a new key for your project.
 - Provide a meaningful description: When generating the API key, you'll be asked to provide a description. Choose a description that clearly identifies the purpose of the key, such as "API key for XYZ project."
 - Copy the generated API key: After generating the key, it will be displayed on the screen. Copy the API key and make sure to save it securely. Note that the key will not be shown again once you leave the page.
 - Update your project with the new API key: In your project's code or configuration, replace the existing API key with the newly generated key. Make sure to use the correct variable or field to store the key.
 - Consider key expiration: As you mentioned that the existing key expires after three months, it's crucial to keep track of the expiration date for the new API key as well. Set a reminder to renew or update the key before it expires to avoid any disruptions in your API access.
 
# Contributing
If you intend to contribute to the repository, please follow the project's guidelines and the standard GitHub workflow for contributing to repositories.

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and opened a ````C#```` repository from GitHub using Visual Studio. Now you can explore, modify, and run the ````C#```` code on your local machine. Visual Studio provides a powerful and user-friendly environment for ````C#```` development, and the ````.NET framework```` offers a robust foundation for building ````C#```` applications. Enjoy coding!
